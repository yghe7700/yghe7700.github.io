!!!!!
K8S provide a lot for than just autoscaling and load balancing. You can technically compare k8s to AWS as a whole.

* !!!!! https://old.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/aali9l/why_k8s_when_aws_offers_autoscaling_and_load/

  * A platform agnostic API to deploy your application - Don't like AWS? Just spin up a k8s cluster on GCP and deploy your application there. Without it you would need to invest a lot of time and effort into rebuilding your infrastructure inside GCP or any other provider. You can even go from cloud to on-prem or deploy your application to multiple cloud providers using the same deployment interfaces/APIs. That is if you don't make use of the extra services that the cloud providers provide.
  Increased application density/cost savings. Rather than spinning up lots of small VMs that all cost a little bit and mostly waste their resources you can pack all the applications onto a fewer number of nodes and make better use of the servers you have.
  Separation of concerns, no need to worry about VMs or keeping your OS up to date, no need to worry about ssh access, logging etc, k8s can do all that for you and let you focus on your application and less on the server supporting it. Though some of this is taken care of if you use their managed services, their managed services can also be very costly when you reach a large scale.
  But that said it is solving similar problems to AWS and GCP so a large amount of what you can do with it you can also achieve with those platforms. AWS/GCP might be better if you can leverage its on demand costing and structure your application to make use of its services - if you don't might being locked into them as a platform.

  Your application may or may not be well suited to k8s or even a containerized environment. It is just one of many solutions out there to help solve a common set of problems in its own way with its own benefits and trade offs that you must take into account when building your applications.

  * !!!!! The real reason people use Kubernetes is because it's a container scheduling system, and most major cloud providers are node scheduling systems. That makes it very, very different from what AWS is doing - instead of launching several nodes for your application and then managing that, you launch several containers per node and manage those.

  That's the unique selling point for Kubernetes - if you want to use containers instead of nodes as your primary layer (and you want to use containers so you can decouple application development and operational deployment needs), and you need a production-grade container scheduling system, you want to use Kubernetes to do it because it's the best at doing it. There really isn't a very strong and compelling equivalent for the same use case that isn't using K8s.

  If you aren't using containers, then don't use Kubernetes and stick to AWS EC2/GCP/DigitalOcean/RackSpace, etc. Simple as that.

  That being said, Kubernetes offers much more than just auto-scaling and load balancing:

  A consistent standardised REST API. This is honestly its biggest feature imo.
  Inbuilt secrets management with Secret types.
  Extensive plugin support that allows you to modify and customise the actual runtime experience (you could choose to write your own custom scheduler for Kubernetes pods, or hijack the API server and have it pass through your own custom auth layer, and so on)
  Support for container design patterns like sidecar pods.
  In-built service discovery and service-to-service networking (Kubernetes will inject service IPs into pods so they can talk to each other at any time)
  I don't have experience with GCP, but almost all of these abstractions are either bundled separately or don't really exist in the flavour you want them to on AWS.

    * !!!!! ^ This is the best answer. To expand a bit:

    AWS is a toolbox of parts. Almost every open-source project uses AWS resources differently. So you can't "mix and match" different projects.

    If you write a deploy system, it will work for you, but won't work for everyone else, because everyone does deploys differently. (i.e. Some do it via SSH, some do it via building/launching a new AMI, Some do routing via ELB, some do it via Nginx, etc. Some use ASGs, some don't, etc.)

    You might store metadata about your nodes in a DynamoDB, or might store annotations in Tags, but someone else might not. So you can write an "overview" page based on your data, but it won't work for anyone else.

    Kubernetes is a Platform. It not only provides an API for all the things it does, but it also provides really simple plug-in mechanism to extend Kubernetes. It standardizes everything from Deployments to Ingresses (web and TCP servers), to fail-over, to security to health checks.

    Some concrete examples:

    - Operators: One way to extend K8s is via Operators. You load a single YAML file, and it now "knows" how to do something new. For example, there is a "MySQL Database Operator". You load that operator once, then say "I want a cluster with 3 replicas". It will create the right pods. The Operator will do all the magic (clustering, backups, fail-over, etc) than a human Operator would have done.

    - Service Mesh: Since K8s knows about all your services, you can load a single YAML file to create a "service mesh" in between all your services. It will monitor all your communication between services and give you data about how they are performing (without touching your code.).

    - Hello World: Every K8s tutorial has a "hello world" example YAML file that works in any cluster. But unlike a "raw AWS box", K8s will handle any node failures (including updating DNS if need be).

  * Well, first of all, it should be "Why to use k8s when AWS offers elastic beanstalk or aws itself"

  k8s doesn't actually have any real load balancing and relies on what you supply: on aws it would elb/nlb/alb on bare metal it probably is going to be metallb.

  K8S provide a lot for than just autoscaling and load balancing. You can technically compare k8s to AWS as a whole.

  Service accounts => AWS IAM Service-Linked Roles

  Pod => ec2

  Ingress => ALB/ELB/NLB

  Persistent Volume Provisioners => EBS/EFS

  Technically you still use autoscaling groups to provision new nodes in your k8s cluster effortlessly, but you workloads are more tightly packed.

  Imagine I have 5 services in 3 different environments two of which are sandbox environments. Without containers it's 5x2 (sandbox) + 5x3 one for each availability zone) ec2 instances. 99% of the time those instances on sandbox do nothing. With k8s I provision one sandbox cluster and one production cluster. For the sandbox, I just give it 3 instances total for each availability zone and k8s will pack the shit out of it. For production, well, depending on the nature of applications, start with 6 instances and see how to goes + add cluster autoscaler.

  Can I solve the same issue with the magic of CMS (C is for Configuration) and Infrastructure as a Code? Sure. Will be as easily manageable? No. Will I be able to transfer what I learned to a different cloud? Nope. Will a be locked into AWS until end of days? Yes.

  On top of everything I get service discovery, secrets management, config maps, easy rolling updates, easy canary updates. Init containers are dope. Setting env variables from configmaps and secrets is dope. Mounting config maps/secrets as a mf volume is dope.

Types of Cloud
There are three cloud types:

Public cloud: Here, the resources and services provided by third-party service providers are available to customers via the Internet.
Private cloud: In a private cloud, the resources and services are managed in-house or by third parties, exclusively for a particular organization.
Hybrid cloud: It is a combination of both public and private cloud types. The decision whether to run the services on public or private depends on some parameters such as the sensitivity of the data and applications, industry certifications and required standards, etc.

  * https://old.reddit.com/r/kubernetes/comments/9a8stj/what_is_gitops_really/
    * !!!!! Yes, but gitops is a system where by there is a system in place which watches the git repository for changes and automatically applies that to the environment even posts back certain things to git.

  An important part of what you would do is having declarative configuration and idempotent deployment code in the repository. So when the environment is not as intended the system should 'make it so'.

  You do not directly use kubectl, etc. the system does that for you.

  The only part you would interact with is: git.

  This makes it very clear who changed what/when/why and does not give the ability to change and thus break things directly.

  Because the only system interacting with Kubernetes itself is the gitops deployment system security and compliance are handles automatically without any extra effort.
